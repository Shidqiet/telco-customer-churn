# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction Using Machine Learning

Hello everyone!

In this data science project, I am gonna try to analyze and predict churn customer from Telco Customer Churn dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/). Churn is phenomenon where customers of a business no longer purchase or interact with the business. A high churn means that higher number of customers no longer want to purchase goods and services from the business.

To extract actionable insights from the dataset. I listed all the questions that came to mind below after assessing the dataset, and I tried to investigate all of them to find the insights:

1. Does the demographic feature (gender, Senior Citizen, Partners, Dependents) have influence on the customers to churn?
2. Does the customer who churn using all of the services that telco gives?
3. For two groups of those customers who churn and not, how long did they usually stay in the service? and what was their average LTV(Life Time Value)?
4. Does expensive charges makes customers churn?

In order to know the answer, please check the notebook!
