# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction Using Machine Learning

Hello everyone!

In this data science project, I am gonna try to analyze and predict churn customer from Telco Customer Churn dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/). Churn is phenomenon where customers of a business no longer purchase or interact with the business. A high churn means that higher number of customers no longer want to purchase goods and services from the business.
